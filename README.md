# FreeLLMAPI

**One OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Eleven free LLM providers. ~1B+ tokens per month.**

Aggregate the free tiers from Google, Groq, Cerebras, SambaNova, NVIDIA, Mistral, OpenRouter, GitHub Models, Cohere, Cloudflare, and Z.ai (Zhipu) behind a single `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Keys are stored encrypted. A Thompson-sampling bandit router picks the best available model for each request — learning from success rate and speed across providers — falls over to the next when one is rate-limited, and tracks per-key usage so you stay under every free-tier cap.

## Why this exists

Every serious AI lab now offers a free tier — a few million tokens a month, a few thousand requests a day. On its own each tier is a toy. Stacked together, they add up to roughly **1.3 billion tokens per month** of working inference capacity, across dozens of models from small-and-fast to reasonably capable.

The problem is that stacking them by hand is painful: fourteen different SDKs, fourteen different rate limits, fourteen places a request can fail. FreeLLMAPI collapses that into one OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Point any OpenAI client library at your local server, and it routes transparently across whichever providers you've added keys for.

## Features

- **OpenAI-compatible** — `POST /v1/chat/completions` and `GET /v1/models` work with the official OpenAI SDKs and any OpenAI-compatible client (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Continue, Hermes, etc.). Just change `base_url`.
- **Streaming and non-streaming** — Server-Sent Events for `stream: true`, JSON response otherwise. Every provider adapter implements both.
- **Tool calling** — OpenAI-style `tools` / `tool_choice` requests are passed through, and assistant `tool_calls` + `tool` role follow-up messages round-trip across providers.
- **Thompson-sampling router** — Each request draws a score from each model's Beta posterior (`Beta(successes + 2, failures + 2)`), adds a normalized tok/s speed term, and subtracts any active rate-limit penalty. The stochastic draw means better models win more often without locking out unproven ones — exploration is automatic and proportional to uncertainty. The dashboard shows the deterministic Bayesian mean of the same posterior for human readability. Rate-limit penalties are model-scoped but only applied once all keys for that model are exhausted — a single key hitting a 429 does not down-rank the model if other keys remain available.
- **Two routing modes** — `freellmapi/auto` (default) balances speed, reliability, and intelligence. `freellmapi/auto-smart` prioritizes model capability (60% intelligence weight) over raw speed — better for complex reasoning tasks where you want the smartest available model even if it streams more slowly.
- **Automatic fallover** — If the chosen provider returns a 429, 5xx, or times out, the router skips it, puts the key on a short cooldown, and retries on the next model in your fallback chain (up to 20 attempts).
- **Per-key rate tracking** — RPM, RPD, TPM, and TPD counters per `(platform, model, key)` so the router always picks a key that's under its caps.
- **Sticky sessions** — Multi-turn conversations keep talking to the same model for 30 minutes to avoid the hallucination spike that comes from mid-conversation model switches.
- **Encrypted key storage** — API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before hitting SQLite; decryption happens in-memory just before a request.
- **Unified API key** — Clients authenticate to your proxy with a single `freellmapi-…` bearer token. You never expose upstream provider keys to your apps.
- **Two-key auth** — Dashboard routes (`/api/*`) require a separate `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_KEY` bearer token; proxy routes (`/v1/*`) require the unified key. The two keys cannot cross routes. `/api/ping` is the only public endpoint.
- **Hardened production mode** — Helmet CSP/HSTS headers enabled, CORS locked to configured origins, generic 500 messages (no stack traces), sensitive request/response logging opt-in only (`LOG_SENSITIVE_DATA=true`).
- **Health checks** — Periodic probes mark keys as `healthy`, `rate_limited`, `invalid`, or `error` so the router skips dead ones automatically.
- **Admin dashboard** — React + Vite UI to manage keys, inspect live routing stats, browse analytics, and run prompts in a playground. Dark mode included.
- **Analytics** — Per-request logging with latency, token counts, success rate, and per-provider breakdowns.
- **Deploys to a Raspberry Pi** — Runs happily on a Pi 4 under PM2 behind nginx. ~40 MB RSS at idle.

## Not yet supported

The scope is deliberately narrow. If a feature isn't on this list and isn't below, assume it isn't there yet.

- **Embeddings** (`/v1/embeddings`)
- **Image generation** (`/v1/images/*`)
- **Audio / speech** (`/v1/audio/*`)
- **Vision / multimodal inputs** — message content is text-only
- **Legacy completions** (`/v1/completions`) — only the chat endpoint is implemented
- **Moderation** (`/v1/moderations`)
- **`n > 1`** (multiple completions per request)
- **Per-user billing / multi-tenant auth** — single-user by design

PRs that add any of these are very welcome. See [Contributing](#contributing).

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (or use [Volta](https://volta.sh) — versions are pinned in `package.json`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tashfeenahmed/freellmapi.git
cd freellmapi
pnpm install

# Generate an encryption key for at-rest key storage
cp .env.example .env
echo "ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")" >> .env
echo "ADMIN_DASHBOARD_KEY=$(node -e "console.log('freellmapi-admin-' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")" >> .env

# Start server + dashboard together
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (the Vite dev UI), add your provider keys on the **Keys** page, and grab your unified API key from the **Keys** page header. That unified key is what you point your OpenAI SDK at.

For a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
node server/dist/index.js     # server + dashboard both served on :3001
```

For production, set `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_KEY` in `.env` and keep it private. The dashboard prompts for this key on first load and stores it in browser local storage to authenticate `/api/*` calls. `/v1/*` clients use the separate unified `freellmapi-…` key shown on the Keys page — the two keys cannot cross routes.

**All `.env` variables:**

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes | 64-char hex key for AES-256-GCM at-rest key encryption. |
| `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_KEY` | Yes (prod) | Bearer token for all `/api/*` dashboard routes. Min 24 chars. Omitting it only works in `NODE_ENV=development`. |
| `ADMIN_CORS_ORIGINS` | No | Comma-separated browser origins allowed to call `/api/*` cross-origin (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`). Same-origin deployments don't need this. |
| `DISABLE_HSTS` | No | Set `true` to skip HSTS headers — useful when terminating TLS at a reverse proxy. |
| `LOG_SENSITIVE_DATA` | No | Set `true` to log full request/response bodies. Off by default; never enable in production. |
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default `3001`). |

## Using the API

Any OpenAI-compatible client works. Examples:

**Python**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:3001/v1",
    api_key="freellmapi-your-unified-key",
)

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="freellmapi/auto",  # let the router pick; or specify e.g. "gemini-2.5-flash"
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarise the fall of Rome in one sentence."}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
print("Routed via:", resp.headers.get("x-routed-via"))
```

**Choosing a routing mode**

```python
# Balanced (default): Optimizes for speed, reliability, and basic capability
client.chat.completions.create(model="freellmapi/auto", ...)

# Smart: Prioritizes intelligence (60% weight) — better for reasoning, coding, analysis
# May trade speed for capability, preferring models like Gemini 2.5 Pro or GPT-4o
client.chat.completions.create(model="freellmapi/auto-smart", ...)
```

**curl**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer freellmapi-your-unified-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "freellmapi/auto",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]
  }'
```

**Streaming**

```python
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="freellmapi/auto",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Stream me a haiku about SQLite."}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
```

**Tool calling**

Pass OpenAI-style `tools` and `tool_choice`; the assistant response round-trips back through the proxy exactly like the OpenAI API. Multi-step flows (assistant `tool_calls` → `tool` role follow-up → final answer) work across every provider the router can reach.

```python
tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather for a city.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["city"],
        },
    },
}]

# 1. Model asks for a tool call
first = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="freellmapi/auto",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Karachi?"}],
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="required",
)
call = first.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0]

# 2. You execute the tool, feed the result back
final = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="freellmapi/auto",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Karachi?"},
        first.choices[0].message,
        {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": call.id, "content": '{"temp_c": 32, "cond": "sunny"}'},
    ],
    tools=tools,
)
print(final.choices[0].message.content)
```

Works with `stream=True` as well — you'll get `delta.tool_calls` chunks followed by a `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` close. Under the hood, OpenAI-compatible providers (Groq, Cerebras, SambaNova, Mistral, OpenRouter, GitHub Models, HuggingFace, Cloudflare, Cohere compat) get the request passed through; Gemini requests get translated into Google's `functionDeclarations` / `functionResponse` shape and the response is translated back.

Every response carries an `X-Routed-Via: <platform>/<model>` header so you can see which provider actually served each call. If a request fell over between providers, you'll also see `X-Fallback-Attempts: N`.

- **Router** (`server/src/services/router.ts`) — Thompson-sampling multi-armed bandit. Samples from each model's Beta posterior over success rate, adds a normalized tok/s speed reward (models below 10 tok/s receive an active penalty), and subtracts a time-decaying rate-limit penalty for recent 429s. The bandit penalty is model-scoped and fires only when all keys for a model are exhausted by 429s in the current retry loop — a single key rate-limiting does not demote the model if other keys remain. Stochastic selection means the router naturally explores new models while converging on faster, more reliable ones as data accumulates.
- **Rate-limit ledger** (`server/src/services/ratelimit.ts`) — in-memory RPM/RPD/TPM/TPD counters backed by SQLite, with cooldowns on 429s.
- **Provider adapters** (`server/src/providers/*.ts`) — one file per provider, implementing the `Provider` base class: `chatCompletion()` and `streamChatCompletion()`.
- **Health service** (`server/src/services/health.ts`) — periodic probe keeps key status fresh.
- **Dashboard** (`client/`) — React + Vite + shadcn/ui admin surface.
- **Storage** — SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) with AES-256-GCM envelope encryption for keys.

## Limitations

Stacking free tiers has real trade-offs. Be honest with yourself about them:

- **No frontier models.** The free-tier catalog tops out around Llama 3.3 70B, GLM-4.5, Qwen 3 Coder, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. You will not get GPT-5 or Claude Opus class reasoning through this. For hard problems, pay for a real API.
- **Intelligence degrades as the day progresses.** Your top-ranked models (usually Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o via GitHub Models) have the lowest daily caps. Once they hit their limits, the router falls down your priority chain to smaller/weaker models. Expect the effective intelligence of the endpoint to drop in the late hours of each day — then reset at UTC midnight.
- **Latency is highly variable.** Cerebras and Groq are extremely fast; others are not. You get whichever one is available.
- **Free tiers can change without notice.** Providers regularly tighten, loosen, or remove free tiers. When that happens you'll see 429s or auth errors until you update the catalog. Re-seed scripts live in `server/src/scripts/`.
- **No SLA, by definition.** If you need reliability, use a paid provider with a contract.
- **Local-first.** There's no multi-tenant auth. Run this for yourself; don't expose it to the internet.

## Contributing

Contributors very welcome! Good first PRs:

- **Add a provider** — copy `server/src/providers/openai-compat.ts` as a template, wire it into `server/src/providers/index.ts`, seed its models in `server/src/db/index.ts`, add a test in `server/src/__tests__/providers/`.
- **Add an endpoint** — embeddings, images, moderations. The provider base class can grow new methods; adapters declare which they support.
- **Improve the router** — cost-aware routing (cheapest-healthy-fastest tradeoffs), better latency-weighted priority, regional pinning.
- **Dashboard polish** — charts on the Analytics page, key rotation UX, batch import of keys from `.env`.
- **Docs** — more examples, client library snippets for Go/Rust/etc., a deployment recipe for Docker or Fly.

**Development loop:**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev         # server on :3001, dashboard on :5173, both with HMR
pnpm test        # vitest — 75 tests across providers, routes, router, ratelimit
```

PRs should include a test, keep the existing test suite green, and match the `.editorconfig` / tsconfig defaults already in the repo. Issues and discussions are open.

## Terms of Service review

A self-hosted, single-user, personal-use setup was re-reviewed against each provider's ToS (May 2026). Summary:

| Provider | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Google Gemini | ⚠️ Caution | March 2026 ToS narrows scope to *"professional or business purposes, not for consumer use"* — a self-hosted developer proxy is still defensible, but the clause is new. |
| Groq | ✅ Likely OK | GroqCloud Services Agreement permits Customer Application integration. |
| Cerebras | ✅ Likely OK | Permitted; explicitly forbids selling/transferring API keys. |
| Mistral | ✅ Likely OK | APIs allowed for personal/internal business use. |
| OpenRouter | ✅ Likely OK | April 2026 ToS sharpens the no-resale / no-competing-service clause; private single-user proxy still fine. |
| SambaNova | ⚠️ Ambiguous | EULA §1.5(c) blocks resale and "service bureau" use; single-user with no third-party access is fine. |
| Cloudflare Workers AI | ⚠️ Ambiguous | No anti-proxy clause; covered by general Self-Serve Subscription Agreement. |
| NVIDIA NIM | ⚠️ Caution | Trial ToS §1.2 / §1.4: *"evaluation only, not production."* Disabled in default catalog. |
| GitHub Models | ⚠️ Caution | Free tier explicitly scoped to *"experimentation"* and *"prototyping."* |
| Cohere | ❌ Avoid | Terms §14 still forbids *"personal, family or household purposes."* |
| Zhipu (open.bigmodel.cn) | ✅ Likely OK | Personal/non-commercial research carve-out still in the platform docs. |
| Z.ai (api.z.ai) | ⚠️ Caution | New row — Singapore entity (distinct from Zhipu CN). §III.3(l) anti-traffic-redirect clause could plausibly be read against a proxy; no explicit personal-use carve-out. |
| Ollama Cloud | ✅ Likely OK | New row — Free plan permits cloud-model access (1 concurrent, 5-hour session caps). No anti-proxy / anti-resale clauses found. *(Integration tracked in #14.)* |

Rules of thumb that keep most providers happy: **one account per provider**, **no reselling**, **no sharing your endpoint with other humans**, **don't hammer a free tier as a paid production backend**. This is informational, not legal advice — read each provider's ToS and make your own call.

Removed since the April 2026 review: Hugging Face, Moonshot, and MiniMax direct integrations were dropped from the catalog (HF — tool-call format issues; Moonshot — moved to paid only; MiniMax — superseded by the OpenRouter `minimax/minimax-m2.5:free` route).

## Disclaimer

**This project is for personal experimentation and learning, not production.** Free tiers exist so developers can prototype against them; they aren't a stable, supported inference substrate and shouldn't be treated as one. If you build something real on top of FreeLLMAPI, swap in a paid API before you ship. Your relationship with each upstream provider is governed by the terms you accepted when you created your account — those terms still apply when the traffic is proxied through this project, and you're responsible for complying with them.
